It is important not to try to fit in too much material. Instead focus on clear and precise definitions, good examples and strong motivations. Exercises A course contains 10 hours of practical work and exercises. an exercise consists of a set of questions to reconstruct typical examples in the software tool a quiz is used to grade the outputs of each exercise Tutorials The course contains 10 hours of self-led tutorials These will be a set of questions, but with online help as needed to build elements of a simplified national model with stylised data (or real data if the participants have it). There will be a quiz to grade output. It will have to focus on insights from the tutorials, so as to avoid the need for personalised grading. Reading The course contains 20 hrs reading.

The reason for this is that text allows quick and easy editing. It is possible to track and attribute changes, fix errors and extend the material. Images, graphics, graphs and diagrams are strongly encouraged as they provide a rich source of information, a pleasant break from text and visual stimulus. However, it is slightly harder to track changes to images and update them. Often images are generated using proprietary software, meaning recreating and updating those images requires access to the original sources or files and the software. Other media, such as video, slides, data, and interactive graphs, Jupyter notebooks can be supported by the teaching kit through links to external sites. For example, videos can be hosted on YouTube and linked to a lecture in the teaching kit. In this mini-lecture, we introduce a powerful text formatting technology called \"Markdown\" and show you how to write simply formatted text, link to websites, and embed images. ::: Markdown Syntax ::: notes Markdown is a \"markup language\" which uses symbols to format text. Once you get used to it, markdown is very quick and easy to use, and lets you perform simple formatting tasks as fast as you can type, without the need to click buttons, or worry about margins and text-wrapping. Markdown is automatically understood (parsed) by a number of websites and converted into HTML (hypertext markup language), the basic building block of a website. By writing markdown, a website can render your text as HTML which is then understood by a web browser. In addition, all the styling, spacing and layout is handled by the web-developer allowing you to focus on the content. ::: Bold and italics Type *Italic* or _Italic_ to get Italic Type **Bold** or __Bold__ to get Bold Blockquotes Type > Blockquote to get: Blockquote Headings Use # Heading 1 to ## Heading 2 , ### Heading 3 etc. Links There are two ways to format links: [An inline link](http://a.com) or [Link][1] This is a good way to record references in a lesson [1]: http://b.org Both appear like this . Bullet Lists Bullet lists can be made with asterix: * a * bullet * list or hyphens: - a - bullet - list which render as: a bullet list Numbered Lists A numbered list like so: 1. a 2. numbered 3. list or like so: 1) a 2) numbered 3) list And these render as: a numbered list Horizontal rules You can use a horizontal rule to break up text: --- which looks like this: Code blocks It can be useful to format code or data using code blocks. These are formatted using \"back ticks\" which look like so: `a piece of code` Use triple back ticks around a block of code. Edit a Markdown document using the Github website In this section, we will learn how to edit a Markdown document using the Github website. Summary In this module, we learnt Markdown syntax. We then used the Github website to edit a Markdown document, and publish it online.

The main components of a RES are energy carriers/commodities and technologies. Energy carriers are things that hold energy, for example crude oil, which is a primary commodity, or electricity, which is a secondary commodity produced using primary commodities. Energy technologies are responsible for conversions between these energy carriers, converting energy from one form to another or to a useful energy service. Energy technologies include: Extraction or importation of primary commodities, such as coal mines, oil rigs or Liquified Natural Gas import facilities Power plants, which typically convert primary commodities to electricity, for example as an oil power plant uses oil to generate electricity or a wind farm generates electricity using energy carried by wind Electricity transmission and distribution technologies Appliances which allow electricity or other secondary commodities to be used to provide a service, such as stoves which allow electricity, biomass or oil products to be used for cooking ::: Primary Energy Key primary energy carriers include: Crude oil Natural gas Coal Water Wind Sunlight Secondary Energy Key secondary energy carriers include: Diesel Kerosene Electricity Biofuels A Reference Energy System ::: notes A RES can be simply represented by a set of lines, representing energy carriers/commodities, and boxes, representing the technologies that convert between these energy carriers. This forms a simplified view of a real-life energy system, which can be used to visualise the links between different commodities and the different technologies available to meet energy demands. Colours often help the user to understand which technologies and commodities are linked, for example in the RES shown above, we can see a chain of green technologies and commodities, showing that a biomass production technology produces the biomass primary commodity, which is then converted to electricity by the biomass power plant. The first step of energy modelling is usually to draw out a RES similar to the one shown above, showing all of the energy demands, technologies and commodities to be considered in the modelling study. This should include all technologies and demands that may be present in the future, even if they do not exist in the present day, to ensure that the scenarios developed are comprehensive. There are several tools that are useful for developing a RES of your own, which will be outlined later in this lecture. Once developed, the RES guides the rest of the modelling process, particularly the data collection. For example, if we were to develop a model based on the RES shown above, we would know that data would be needed for all of the technologies shown, as well as all of the primary commodities and final demands. As detailed on the next slide, Sankey Diagrams can help you to understand your country\u2019s energy situation, developing your own RES and collect data. ::: Sankey Diagrams Visualise Energy Flows ::: notes An effective way to visualize energy system flows is through Sankey diagrams. A Sankey diagram is a graphic illustration of flows - like energy- where they can be combined, split and traced through a series of events or stages (see figure). The width of each stream represents the amount of energy in the flow. Sankey diagrams, which are typically used to visualize energy transfers between processes, are named after the Irishman Matthew H. P. R. Sankey, who used this type of diagram in a publication on the energy efficiency of a steam engine in 1898. In this case, it is presented the Sankey diagram of the International Energy Agency (IEA) which represents the world energy balance. However, many institutions and international organizations provide this kind of tools (i.e. The Eurostat Sankey diagram tool from the European Union). A Sankey diagram reproduces \u2013 in visual form \u2013 energy balances that are sometimes represented in a table or a spreadsheet. The structure of an energy balance visualized with a Sankey diagram has the following characteristics: On the left side there are the streams associated with the production of primary resources and their imports; Then moving on the right side, there are energy flows which account for export, transformation and power losses Finally, on the right side we can see the total final consumption divided by sectors (industry, transport, other and non-energy use) IEA Sankey diagram tool gives you the possibility to analyse in detail the final consumption into specific sectors. To do so, you should refer to the Final Consumption Sankey diagram. ::: Using a Sankey Diagram ::: notes As during this course you will be asked to build your own Reference Energy System (RES) it is important to get familiar with these kind of tools to gather important information and data. The following features are freely available: Select subject: Balance or Final Consumption Active country and year: you can visualize the selected country and the specific year represented Select unit: Millions of tonnes of oil equivalent or Petajoules Select country/region: this particular tool allow you to visualise specific data for up to 125 countries and 9 regions Animation bar - Press to play and see how the energy flow changed during the years. Show a time graph of the selected flows: you can click on time graph, then select an energy flow by clicking on it and visualize the trends Show a pie chart at specific hubs: this is a particularly valuable tool to understand which is the supply in each sector. (i.e. Final consumption -> transport -> road and you will see that in 2018 93% of the road demand is addressed using Oil products, then the rest with Natural gas, Biofuels and waste and Electricity.

The reason for this is that text allows quick and easy editing. It is possible to track and attribute changes, fix errors and extend the material. Images, graphics, graphs and diagrams are strongly encouraged as they provide a rich source of information, a pleasant break from text and visual stimulus. However, it is slightly harder to track changes to images and update them. Often images are generated using proprietary software, meaning recreating and updating those images requires access to the original sources or files and the software. Other media, such as video, slides, data, and interactive graphs, Jupyter notebooks can be supported by the teaching kit through links to external sites. For example, videos can be hosted on YouTube and linked to a lecture in the teaching kit. In this mini-lecture, we introduce a powerful text formatting technology called \"Markdown\" and show you how to write simply formatted text, link to websites, and embed images. ::: Markdown Syntax ::: notes Markdown is a \"markup language\" which uses symbols to format text. Once you get used to it, markdown is very quick and easy to use, and lets you perform simple formatting tasks as fast as you can type, without the need to click buttons, or worry about margins and text-wrapping. Markdown is automatically understood (parsed) by a number of websites and converted into HTML (hypertext markup language), the basic building block of a website. By writing markdown, a website can render your text as HTML which is then understood by a web browser. In addition, all the styling, spacing and layout is handled by the web-developer allowing you to focus on the content. ::: Bold and italics Type *Italic* or _Italic_ to get Italic Type **Bold** or __Bold__ to get Bold Blockquotes Type > Blockquote to get: Blockquote Headings Use # Heading 1 to ## Heading 2 , ### Heading 3 etc. Links There are two ways to format links: [An inline link](http://a.com) or [Link][1] This is a good way to record references in a lesson [1]: http://b.org Both appear like this . Bullet Lists Bullet lists can be made with asterix: * a * bullet * list or hyphens: - a - bullet - list which render as: a bullet list Numbered Lists A numbered list like so: 1. a 2. numbered 3. list or like so: 1) a 2) numbered 3) list And these render as: 1) a 2) numbered 3) list Horizontal rules You can use a horizontal rule to break up text: --- which looks like this: Code blocks It can be useful to format code or data using code blocks. These are formatted using \"back ticks\" which look like so: `a piece of code` Use triple back ticks around a block of code. Edit a Markdown document using the Github website In this section, we will learn how to edit a Markdown document using the Github website. Summary In this module, we learnt Markdown syntax. We then used the Github website to edit a Markdown document, and publish it online.
