# Test Course for the Teaching Kit

A course consists of 60 hours of study split across four types of study:

- 20 lecture blocks of one hour each, further broken down into 4 mini-lectures, multiple-choice exams and absorption time
- 10 hours of exercises where the student solves typical problems with the tool
- 10 hours of tutorials which lead the student through the goal of constructing a simple national model
- 20 hours (or 100 pages) of reading

In this example repository, we demonstrate a minimal working folder structure with one [lecture block](./block_1/) containing mini-lectures ([lecture_1](./block_1/lecture_1.md),
[lecture_2](./block_1/lecture_2.md)), [quiz](/block_1/quiz_1.md) and absorption, [tutorial](./tutorial.md), exercises and reading materials.
